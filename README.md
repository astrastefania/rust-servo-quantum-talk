# "Rust, Servo and Firefox Quantum
### The history through a personal tale

This talk was offered during a Rust Night in Turin:  
http://torinocodingsociety.it/events/torino-coding-society-23gen18

For the slides I used [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com).
The content is filled with great resources, so enjoy the readings.  

If you don't speak Italian last slide refers to the saying "E questo Ã¨ quanto!" that could be translated in "That's it!". ;)

A special thanks to the Mozilla community in Berlin for the support, resources and great memories mentioned in the talk, to old and new friends in Turin and to Mozilla Italia all around the country.
